## Status

React-Native + Javascript is the approved

## Context

A programming language and interface must be provided that can support the ease of maintainability as well easy API integration. The are many different requirements such as, frequent updates, which call for an easy to understand programming language with exstensive documentation. Furthermore, APIs that integrate MapBox, Google Maps, Websockets, and Database management have to be included in the program. These combined requirements as well as non-functional performance and security requirements must be considered when selecting an ideal programming language.

## Decision

Using Javascript within the React Native CLI provides developers with a universally well understood and documented programming interface. Documentation standards is well understood in Javascript which would help with maintainability, which is useful for ensuring frequent updates to the app. Javascript also provides many ways to integrate useful APIs to make the app more functional. This will be crucial when implementing features like Google Maps or MapBox. Node modules can also be implement which can integrate MySQL databases, which is extremely useful when creating an app which has to keep records of users, transactions, drivers etc. Javascript also has APIs for websocket to ensure a secure connection between the app and the company web server.

## Consequences

Using Javascript will be beneficial for developing a transportation app, as it is easy to understand and easy to maintain. Many of the requirements can be met with rudimentary understandings of how Javascript and React Native work. The simplicity of Javascript makes it easy to develop high quality apps which meet requirements. Javascript is used for developing Hybrid Apps which meets the need of providing a service on both IOS and Android. However, Javascript has client-side security vulnerabilities, as code is easily available to be viewed which can be used for malicious reasons. This of course would require developers to understand security techniques to ensure sensitive information is safe while programming this app.
