## Status:
Data Storage: A web-based server is approved. 

## Context:
A transport app requires constant updates for driver location, pick up spots and drop offs. Therefore, data storage is a very crucial tool that is needed for this app. Having the right data storage is also key to having the app run smoothly and without downtime. 


## Decision:
A web-based server such as Amazon web services, Microsoft Azure, and Web Socket are all great options. With all the capabilities that web servers offer, we think that it would be a more efficient route than having to buy a lot of expensive equipment. This would also cut down on needing a “server room” for your business and a tech crew as data management would be easier and have less manpower needed to manage the data on a day-to-day basis.  


## Consequences:
Web based servers are a more efficient way to handle data. They support multiple websites, have lower hardware requirements, have support for multiple websites and have more flexibility for customizing your data options. However, there is always the possibility of a server crash and having to wait on the host site to get the server back up and running. This can take hours or days, and you would have to contact support in this type of situation. Where having your own server could cut this time down if you had someone in charge of that. This happens very rarely though so the savings and efficiency would be worth that risk in our minds.
