## Status:

Approved - Python Functions integrated into Javascript

## Context:
 We are codnsidering integrating two languages together to improve the functonal;ity and maintenance of the app. There are a few languages that this can be done with . Python functions and JavaScript are one of the few ways that this can be achieved. There are tools that can also help with this integration. Brython and Transcrypt both help compile both codes and implement it into a website or app. This will save time in many ways.

## Decision:

By integrating Pyhton functions into JavaScript we can take full advantage of in real time data. This can help with mapping, drop offs and pick up locations. Utilizing this will keep things on time and costs low. The functionality will also help through the day-to-day operations. 

## Consequences

With using tools like Brython or Transcrypt, it makes integration of these two languages easy. By integrating Python functions and JavaScript there are many advantages. You are able to re use code blocks ,improve performance and use the strengths of both languages. However, there are drawbacks such this is a more complex way of doing things and development may take longer to get the app finished. Debugging may also be harder as there are two languages that have to be looked at. In the end we think that this would be the best option if optimized correctly. We believe the functionality and efficiency would outweigh the negative aspects.
